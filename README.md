# Algorithm Design-Travelling Salesperson Problem (TSP)

### Description

[Project Description]()

Routing Algorithm for Ocean Shipping and Urban Deliveries. <br>

Analyse the Travelling Salesperson Problem (TSP) and design heuristics to solve it, using several datasets from the context of ocean shipping and urban deliveries. 

### Alrorithms used:
* Backtracking 
* Triangular approximation
* ACO
* Annealing
* Christofieds

### Results:
